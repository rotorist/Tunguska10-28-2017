One night in 1908, when my grand mother was just a young girl living in Sibera, she witnessed a devastating explosion in the sky. 

This explosion lit up her home hundreds of kilometers away like a winter sun, and flattened an entire forest to the ground. It was known as the Tunguska Event, and scientists quickly dismissed it as just a stray asteroid. 

I wish it was really that simple.

After the Great Wars, an abundance of plutonium ore was found near the event site, and it quickly brought prosperity to Tunguska. But the region suddenly fell into the hands of Death within a decade of its modernization. 

Residents mysteriously mutated into devilish beasts and it quickly spreaded across Tunguska. The authorities quickly quarantined the area, and named it officially as the Tunguska Exclusion Zone.Tunguska was left to rot in isolation.

While the healthy residents were evacuated, some researchers stayed behind to study the mutation and find a cure. No cure was found, but an accidental discovery triggered a gold rush in Tunguska. 

Despite the government's effort to cover up and the Zone's immense danger, prospectors flooded into the Exclusion Zone, hunting for mutants and used their organs to concoct highly priced "serums". Some stroke gold, most perished. But it never stopped those who would rather risk death in the Zone, than to loiter their lives away in the motionless world outside.

My brother, Boris Kravshenko, was one of them.
