Today I have arrived at the outskirts of Tunguska. The whole area is isolated, hundreds of kilometers away from civilization, but there are a lot of roads and railroads leading to it. Most are destroyed, the rest heavily guarded. I took half year of vacation from work, hoping to strike gold in the Zone so I'll never have to see those buttfaces again. A friend dropped me off near this smaller checkpoint so I could hike up the narrow dirt road, and somehow sneak through it. I dont' know what's ahead of me... But I do know one thing for sure: it ain't no vacation.
