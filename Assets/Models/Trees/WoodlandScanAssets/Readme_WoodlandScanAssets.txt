Thankyou for your purchase!

These assets have been created using photoscanning and
are ready to drag and drop into your scene. They are a 
basic normal map & albedo map setup with the 
highlights/shadows removed as much as practical from the
original scan textures.

Notes:
- By default the textures have been set to a max size of
2048 but are 4096 textures and you may wish to change these
settings. If you wish to edit these in bulk you can select 
all of the textures in Unity and edit one textures
properties to affect all that is selected. You may need to
do this separately for the normal and the albedo texture
types
- You may wish to change the LOD percentages for your own
project
