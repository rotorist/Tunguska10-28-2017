Buildings Bundle 1

----------------------

Version History:

	Version 1.0	November 2015	Initial Release

----------------------

Contents:

	10 residential houses with textured interiors and exteriors / 1 brick house, 3 stone houses, 3 wood houses, 3 plaster houses /  10 .fbx models / 62 .png textures

	Each model is broken down into child objects which vary but may include: base, front door, back door, second floor, roof, awning, and steps

	Doors are either left-handed or right handed with their object origins set to their hinge locations to make animating in Unity easier

	62 1024x1024 PNG textures: 2 glass textures, 16 planks textures, 15 plaster textures, 3 shingles textures, 1 slate texture, 5 flat stone textures, 2 round stone textures, 8 thatch/thatch-end textures, 1 tile roof texture, and 9 window/door textures

	All materials work well using Unity's Standard Shader / glass materials work well with Rendering Mode switched from Opaque to Transparent
	
	All models scaled for Unity 5

	Model composition varies greatly but rough per-model averages are: verts- 2284, faces- 1758, tris- 3574.
